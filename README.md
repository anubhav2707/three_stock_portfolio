# three_stock_portfolio
A portfolio over 10 year period between HDFC liquid fund, Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty 50

Whenever a stock price (Nifty Midcap100 and Nifty 50) goes above 40 days moving average then a buy signal is generated.
If it goes vice- versa then a sell signal is generated.
When a buy signal is generated for a stock then 60 percent of weightage is given to it.
when a sell signal is generated then the weightage of stock becomes zero and our money is invested in HDFC Liquid Fund
